## Coming Soon: Adaptive Scoring Engine

**Currently,** our system evaluates answers using a fixed formula with static weights (`alpha` and `beta`):

`Score = (α × Semantic_Score) + (β × Thematic_Score)`

**We are developing an upgrade:** An adaptive engine that learns from human feedback.

### How It Will Work:
When an educator adjusts an AI-generated score, the system will use this correction as a learning opportunity. Over time, it will automatically fine-tune the `alpha` and `beta` parameters to better align with that educator's unique grading style.

**The result:** An AI that becomes a smarter, more personalized grading assistant.

**Status:** Under active development.
